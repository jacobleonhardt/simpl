## Database
Using PostgreSQL for the database: psql (PostgreSQL) 14.3 (as of 06-14-2022)

## Backend
For the backend I'm using Rails. I like Ruby and Python for backend coding, but I think Ruby is much more convenient for creating and handling models than Python.

## Frontend
I was initially going to use Ruby on Rails for the front end. However, one thing I've come across when working with Ruby on Rails is that the static nature of it means I have to infuse some JS into it (such as Stimulus) to make it operate dynamically. React is... well, reactionary. When it registers a change in the virtual DOM, it will rigger the render and update the content for us. It's quick and I like the UX it provides.
